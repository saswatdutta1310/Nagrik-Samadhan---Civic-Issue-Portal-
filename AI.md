# 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

Transparency and responsibility are core values of **Nagrik Samadhan**. This document outlines how we leverage Artificial Intelligence in our development process.

---

## ✅ Summary

We use AI tools strictly as **productivity assistants**.
-   **No "Black Box" Code**: Every line of code generated or suggested by AI is reviewed, understood, and tested by a human developer.
-   **Human-Led Architecture**: Key decisions regarding database schema, system architecture, and security are made by the team, not AI.

## 🧠 Tool Usage

### 1. Development Assistants (Antigravity / GitHub Copilot / ChatGPT)
-   **Agentic Workflow**: Automating complex multi-step coding tasks and refactors (Antigravity).
-   **Boilerplate Generation**: Generating repetitive code structures (e.g., standard React components, TypeScript interfaces).
-   **Documentation**: Drafting initial versions of documentation (READMES, comments).
-   **Debugging**: Analyzing stack traces and suggesting potential fixes.

### 2. Cloud AI Services (Google Cloud)
-   **Google Maps Platform**: Used for geolocation, map rendering, and place selection. This is a deterministic API service, not generative AI.

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance

To ensure the reliability of our codebase:
1.  **Manual Review**: All AI suggestions undergo a peer review process.
2.  **Testing**: Code is validated through manual testing and unit tests where applicable.
3.  **Security**: We manually verify that no sensitive data (API keys, credentials) is exposed in AI prompts or generated code.

## ⚖️ Statement of Responsibility

The **BYTE BUSTERS** team takes full responsibility for the integrity, security, and functionality of the Nagrik Samadhan platform. AI is a tool we use to move faster, but it does not replace our engineering judgment.
